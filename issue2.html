        <h2>Fontaine‚Äôs Finest News Source</h2>
        
        <h3>BREAKING NEWS: HILICHURLS START FARMING? TEAPOT BLUEPRINT DISCOVERY SHOCKS FONTAINE!</h3>
        <p><strong>By: The Steambird Investigative Team</strong></p>
        <p>Fontaine‚Äîwhere justice is served, water is everywhere, and apparently, Hilichurls are now in the agriculture business?</p>
        <p>Earlier today, The Steambird uncovered a remarkable chest fiercely guarded by a group of Fontaine Hilichurls and a Mitachurl. Expecting riches, artifacts, or even contraband, our reporter braved the danger to reveal the shocking truth: Inside the chest was a teapot blueprint titled "Court of Justice Green Grocers."</p>
        <p>That‚Äôs right. Hilichurls were protecting farming infrastructure.</p>
        
        <h3>WHAT COULD THIS MEAN?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>üå± Hilichurls turning to agriculture? Could this be a peaceful movement?</li>
            <li>üçÖ A secret black-market produce operation? Is Fontaine's food industry about to face unexpected competition?</li>
            <li>üèõÔ∏è Court of Justice involvement? Who authorized this?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>NEW DEVELOPMENTS: THE GARDENMEK CONSPIRACY</h3>
        <p>Following this discovery, our investigation led us to an unusual sight: Gardemeks stationed near a Roger Airship, as well as a lone Roller Mek patrolling the hill above the shore. Their proximity to Hilichurl activity raises questions. Who programmed them? What are they guarding?</p>
        
        <h3>SUSPICIOUS TREASURE HOARDER ACTIVITY</h3>
        <p>A deeper dive led us to a hidden operation near the Court of Fontaine. Multiple Treasure Hoarders were spotted near small boats, one of which was actively being used. Among them, a higher-ranking member with a golden raven insignia was present. Upon their defeat, the leader mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind only a small wooden box with 1,000 Mora floating behind the boat.</p>
        
        <h3>THE INVISIBLE SHIP MYSTERY</h3>
        <p>But the biggest shock came from under the waters near the Court of Fontaine. Hidden among shipwrecks, a ghostly blue ship flickered in and out of visibility, vanishing entirely upon close approach. Nearby, a strange floating device hovered above the water. What purpose does it serve?</p>
