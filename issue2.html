            <h3>BREAKING NEWS: HILICHURLS TURN FARMERS?</h3>
            <p><strong>By: The Steambird Investigative Team</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Fontaine</strong> ‚Äî Where the seas whisper secrets and justice reigns supreme, an unexpected phenomenon has surfaced: Hilichurls, the once-feared tribal creatures of Teyvat, have seemingly abandoned their usual marauding ways in favor of something far more... agricultural?</p>
            <p>Reports from the Beryl Region suggest that a group of Fontaine Hilichurls has been spotted engaging in behaviors more befitting a dedicated farmer than a wandering warrior. Witnesses describe scenes of these creatures carefully tilling soil, watering plants, and‚Äîmost astonishingly‚Äîguarding their crops from intruders with a ferocity usually reserved for treasure hoards.</p>
            <p>One such eyewitness, renowned adventurer <strong>Henri Leclair</strong>, described the bizarre encounter: <em>"At first, I thought I was seeing things. Hilichurls usually charge at you with clubs, not watering cans! But there they were, tending to a small field of mushrooms and Nilotpala Lotuses, seemingly ignoring us unless we got too close."</em></p>
            <p>The reason for this unexpected shift? The Steambird has uncovered evidence that these Hilichurls were fiercely protecting a <strong>remarkable chest</strong> containing a <strong>blueprint titled 'Court of Justice's Green Grocers'</strong>. This blueprint appears to detail an advanced farming structure, hinting at the possibility that these creatures may have been influenced‚Äîor even directed‚Äîto farm as part of a larger, unknown plan.</p>
            <p>According to Fontaine‚Äôs <strong>Scholar of Anthropology, Enzo Moreau</strong>, the behavior of these Hilichurls suggests possible alchemical interference. <em>"Hilichurls have never demonstrated this level of organization or understanding of cultivation,"</em> he explained in an exclusive interview with <em>The Steambird</em>. <em>"It is possible that an external force‚Äîperhaps an alchemist experimenting with environmental influences‚Äîhas triggered this shift. The question is: Why?"</em></p>
            <p>However, not everyone is convinced that science alone is to blame. A more concerning theory has emerged from <strong>Ludivine Argente</strong>, a specialist in Abyssal Studies, who warns that this could be the result of <em>Abyssal corruption or even long-lost Khaenri‚Äôahn influence.</em> <em>"We have seen ancient civilizations manipulate lesser beings for their own purposes before. The question is whether these Hilichurls are truly farming‚Ä¶ or if they are cultivating something meant for a greater, more dangerous purpose."</em></p>
            <p>Regardless of the cause, one thing is clear: Fontaine‚Äôs farmers may soon have unexpected competition. Stay tuned as <em>The Steambird</em> continues to investigate the mystery of the agrarian Hilichurls!</p>
