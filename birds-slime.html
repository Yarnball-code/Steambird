        <h3>BREAKING NEWS: BIRDS, SLIME, AND A MITACHURL - A SECRET ALLIANCE?</h3>
        <p><strong>By: Reporter Felix</strong></p>
        <p>Fontaine has always been a land of mystery, but today, an unusual gathering raises more questions than answers. Three birds, an anemo slime, and a mitachurl were spotted in a clandestine meeting, guarding a common chest deep in the heart of Fontaine. What could they possibly be hiding? What are they planning?</p>
        <p>Upon arrival at the scene, the birds seemed to communicate in hushed chirps, their beady eyes watching closely as if sensing an intruder. The anemo slime floated ominously nearby, ready to strike, while the mitachurl stood guard, gripping its weapon like a silent enforcer.</p>
        <p>Fearing a larger conspiracy, expert reinforcements were called in. After a valiant battle, the so-called "guardians" were defeated, and the chest was finally opened. However, its contents were disappointingly mundane‚Äîmere adventurer‚Äôs supplies. Was this just a simple coincidence, or was the true treasure hidden elsewhere before our arrival?</p>
        <p>Suspicions arose that this operation might be linked to the infamous pigeons of Mondstadt, known for their deep-seated grudges and elusive tactics. A visit to Mondstadt was promptly made for further investigation. Upon reaching the city, key figures were notably absent‚ÄîJean, the Acting Grandmaster, and Lisa, the Head Librarian. With no immediate leads from the library, attention turned to the iconic bridge where the pigeon mastermind, Timmy, is usually found.</p>
        <p>At nightfall, however, Timmy was nowhere to be seen. Even more suspiciously, his pigeons had disappeared as well. Historical records from early 2020 tell of a time when disturbing these birds would summon ruin guards. Though this phenomenon has since ceased, one can‚Äôt help but wonder: did Timmy foresee our arrival? Did he evacuate the birds to prevent further questioning?</p>
        <p>The case remains open, and investigations will continue. If you see any suspicious avian activity, report it to your local Adventurer‚Äôs Guild immediately.</p>
