            <h3>BREAKING NEWS: FIRE AND FRAGRANCE ‚Äî THE ENIGMA OF EMILIE</h3>
            <p><strong>By: Reporter Felix</strong></p>
            <p>Fontaine‚Äôs premier perfumer is more than just a master of scent‚Äîshe walks the fine line between art and ashes, weaving her craft through both fragrance and flame. Reports suggest that Emilie‚Äôs presence on the battlefield is nothing short of mesmerizing, her flames reducing foes to embers with eerie precision. But is her control over fire a trade secret or something more?</p>
            <p>Field tests conducted by The Steambird reveal that Emilie‚Äôs abilities are not just for show. In a rigorous combat trial, she worked alongside Gaming, Baizhu, and Kinich to eliminate high-level threats in both the Chasm and Fontaine‚Äôs most dangerous domains. In a stunning display, a Ruin Guard and Ruin Grader were reduced to scrap metal within 30 seconds, her flames persisting even against mechanical foes. However, the same could not be said for a Pyro Abyss Mage‚Äîher flames vanished without a trace, forcing a full team effort to break its shield.</p>
            <p>With this duality of power in mind, we sought out the perfumer herself at Caf√© Lutce to uncover the truth behind her talents.</p>
            
            <h2>INTERVIEW WITH EMILIE: THE PERFUMER WHO WALKS AMONG FLAMES</h2>
            <p><strong>Conducted at Caf√© Lutce by Reporter Felix</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Steambird Reporter Felix:</strong> "Emilie, your reputation as Fontaine‚Äôs finest perfumer is well known, but recent field reports suggest your mastery of flame is just as remarkable. Tell us‚Äîhow does someone in your profession come to wield such power?"</p>
            <p><strong>Emilie:</strong> "Forensic cleaning. After investigations end, I dispose of organic matter, remove stains, and sanitize crime scenes. It‚Äôs a job that demands precision‚Äîjust like perfumery."</p>
            <p><strong>Steambird Reporter Felix:</strong> "You take private commissions. Have you ever come across a case where the truth was deliberately hidden?"</p>
            <p><strong>Emilie:</strong> "Discretion is part of the job. My work exposes me to sensitive information, and the people who hire me trust that I won‚Äôt bring them unwanted attention."</p>
            <p><strong>Steambird Reporter Felix:</strong> "Your perfumes are said to be as meticulous as your work as a forensic cleaner. Could you tell us about your studio? What goes into crafting a truly memorable scent?"</p>
            <p><strong>Emilie:</strong> "Every perfume goes through rigorous testing‚Äîshelf-life, deterioration, toxicity. I wonder... wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we could test relationships the same way?"</p>
