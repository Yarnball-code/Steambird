        <h2>Flight, Feathers, and Foul Play?</h2>

        <article>
            <h3>By: Reporter Felix</h3>
            <p>Deep in Fontaine‚Äôs wilderness, an eerie scene has unfolded‚Äîa strange coalition of birds and slimes, a nest of freshly laid eggs, and an empty clearing where something seems... missing.</p>
            <p>When this reporter arrived on the scene, two distinct species of birds were present. One group, smaller and clustered near a Dendro slime, seemed almost engaged in silent deliberation. Meanwhile, a separate, larger pair circled ominously overhead, never landing. A nest of still-warm eggs sat nearby‚Äîevidence that the birds had been here recently, yet none of them claimed the nest as their own.</p>
            <p>However, the real mystery began after the battle. When the large slime was defeated, its smaller companions mysteriously vanished. And then, the birds returned‚Äîbut now, only the circling ones remained, hovering over an empty clearing with no explanation.</p>
            <p>What were they waiting for? Why did they never land? Was this simply a natural oddity, or a carefully staged event?</p>
            <p>Despite a full investigation‚Äîincluding elemental sight sweeps, terrain searches, and even an attempted offering of eggs‚Äîno further developments were discovered. The birds remained in their eerie, silent patrol.</p>
            <p>Fontaine‚Äôs mysteries rarely stay buried forever, so if you witness any similar avian anomalies, report them immediately. Are we dealing with a secret bird-slime pact? A lost treasure? A strange ritual? Only time will tell.</p>
            <p><em>Could this be related to the secret bird-slime-mitachurl alliance first reported in <a href="issue1.html">Issue #1</a>? The investigation continues.</em></p>
