            <h3>BREAKING NEWS: HILICHURLS START FARMING?</h3>
            <p><strong>By: The Steambird Investigative Team</strong></p>
            <p>Fontaine‚Äîwhere justice is served, water is everywhere, and apparently, Hilichurls are now in the agriculture business?</p>
            <p>Earlier today, The Steambird uncovered a remarkable chest fiercely guarded by a group of Fontaine Hilichurls and a Mitachurl...</p>
            <p>Eyewitnesses report seeing these Hilichurls carefully tending to a field near the Beryl Region, watering plants, and even attempting rudimentary farming techniques. Could this be a sign of evolution, or is something‚Äîor someone‚Äîbehind this agricultural revolution?</p>
            <p>Local scholar Enzo Moreau suggests that this might be an experimental attempt by a rogue alchemist to domesticate Hilichurls for economic gain. However, opponents argue that the creatures may have simply stumbled upon an abandoned garden and taken an interest in it.</p>
            <p>More research is needed, but one thing is for certain: Fontaine‚Äôs farmers may soon have unexpected competition.</p>
