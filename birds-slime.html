        <h3>🚨 BREAKING NEWS: BIRDS, SLIME, AND A MITACHURL - A SECRET ALLIANCE? 🚨</h3>
        <p><strong>By: Reporter Felix</strong></p>
        <p>Fontaine has always been a land of mystery, but today, an unusual gathering raises more questions than answers. Three birds, an anemo slime, and a mitachurl were spotted in a clandestine meeting, guarding a common chest deep in the heart of Fontaine. What could they possibly be hiding? What are they planning?</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>Upon arrival at the scene, the birds seemed to communicate in hushed chirps, their beady eyes watching closely as if sensing an intruder. The anemo slime floated ominously nearby, ready to strike, while the mitachurl stood guard, gripping its weapon like a silent enforcer...</p>
            <p><strong>The case remains open. If you see any suspicious avian activity, report it to your local Adventurer’s Guild immediately.</strong></p>
