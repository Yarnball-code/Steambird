            <h3>Breaking News: Hilichurls Start Farming? Teapot Blueprint Discovery Shocks Fontaine!</h3>
            <p>Fontaine—where justice is served, water is everywhere, and apparently, Hilichurls are now in the agriculture business?</p>
            <p>Earlier today, The Steambird uncovered a remarkable chest fiercely guarded by a group of Fontaine Hilichurls and a Mitachurl. Expecting riches, artifacts, or even contraband, our reporter braved the danger to reveal the shocking truth: Inside the chest was a teapot blueprint titled "Court of Justice Green Grocers."</p>
            <p>That’s right. Hilichurls were protecting farming infrastructure.</p>
            
            <h3>What Could This Mean?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hilichurls turning to agriculture? Could this be a peaceful movement? Are they tired of foraging and looting and ready to settle down into society?</li>
                <li>A secret black-market produce operation? Is Fontaine's food industry about to face unexpected competition?</li>
                <li>Court of Justice involvement? The name of the blueprint raises questions—who authorized this? Is the judicial system secretly supporting Hilichurlian self-sufficiency?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>New Developments: The Gardenmek Conspiracy</h3>
            <p>Following this discovery, our investigation led us to an unusual sight: Gardemeks stationed near a Roger Airship, as well as a lone Roller Mek patrolling the hill above the shore. While their presence may seem routine, the proximity to Hilichurl activity raises questions. Who programmed them? What are they guarding?</p>
            
            <h3>Suspicious Treasure Hoarder Activity</h3>
            <p>A deeper dive led us to a hidden operation near the Court of Fontaine. Multiple Treasure Hoarders were spotted near small boats, one of which was actively being used. Among them, a higher-ranking member with a golden raven insignia was present. Upon their defeat, the leader mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind only a small wooden box with 1,000 Mora floating behind the boat.</p>
            
            <h3>The Invisible Ship Mystery</h3>
            <p>Hidden among shipwrecks, a ghostly blue ship flickered in and out of visibility, vanishing entirely upon close approach. Nearby, a strange floating device hovered above the water. What purpose does it serve? Who controls these spectral vessels?</p>
            
            <h3>Investigative Next Steps:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Track further Treasure Hoarder movements—was this a failed smuggling operation?</li>
                <li>Study Gardemek behavior—are they really just on routine patrols?</li>
                <li>Seek expert opinions on the ghostly ship—are we dealing with advanced technology, or something... paranormal?</li>
            </ul>
